        <p> I am an incoming freshman at college, and I am looking forward to exploring Computer Science and other fields in Engineering. I aim to participate in as many new clubs and organizations to find new interests. I also want to get involved in a robotics club, research, and internships to enhance my degree. I also enjoy playing music alongside. I have experience playing the piano and double bass. Having experience playing the double bass in a high school regional orchestra and having passed Grade 5 in ABRSM for piano, I look forward to further developing my musicality by creating projects in music technology.
